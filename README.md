## History

This game was originally created by Maps Mania in 2023 [(article)](maps-mania-article) which was in turn inspired by [SF Street Names](sf-street-names).

It was created as a project on [Glitch](glitch), which allowed me to "remix" the project with a few enhancements, such as progress saving and more lenient input handling.

Glitch has since closed the doors on their hosting service, so I have migrated the game to an alternative hosting service, with the source code now available here on GitHub. The app is currently hosted on [Fastly Compute](fastly-compute) using [js-compute-static-publish](js-compute-static-publish).

## Structure

- `/public` contains the static files that make up the game â€“ the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

- `/compute-js` contains the source code for the Fastly Compute service that serves the files from the `/public` directory.

- `/` the root of the repository contains the Terraform configuration for the DNS zone and Fastly TLS configuration.

## License

I am not the original author of this game, so I cannot license it. The original author retained the default Glitch license file in their project, but did not insert their name, so I am not able to provide a concrete answer to anyone's rights over this project. I maintain this repository in the interest of preserving and sharing this enjoyable game. Please refer to the [original article on Maps Mania][maps-mania-article] for more information on the project's usage rights.
