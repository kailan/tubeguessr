A remix of ~london-underground-stations with some QoL improvements, namely:
* Spelling mistakes/typos are accepted
* Page layout is easier to understand and use on mobile
* "Hints" and map layers have been removed
* Score is stored persistently in the browser
* Feedback if you have already guessed a station
